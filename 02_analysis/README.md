# 02_analysis

This directory contains jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) used to process, analyze, and visualize results. Code within these directories also initiate training and validation of offset models from the *Climate Novelty* and *Nuisance Environment* workflows.

Notebooks are best viewed in a jupyter session (for collapsing and scrolling cell outputs) but are hyperlinked for viewing on nbviewer.org within each directory's README.

These directories are outlined in Supplemental Note S2 (Coding Workflows) in the manuscript.
