"""Fit trained GF models to climate outlier climates.

Usage
-----
python MVP_climate_outlier_fitting.py argpkl

Parameters
----------
argpkl path to a .pkl file that contains a list, where each list is a tuple of input args. The input args are:

gfOut_trainingfile - file path to trained gradient forest object, saved as .RDS
garden_file - tab delimited .txt file path with columns for `lat`, `lon`, and each env used in training
   - data can be current, future, or uniform (eg for common garden) climate
predfile - path to RDS of object saved from interpolating gradient forest model across landscape
   for the same time period as the data that went into training (created in gradient_training.R)
basename - the basename prefix wanted for saving files in `save_dir`
save_dir - the directory where files should be saved

Notes
-----
this effectively runs the commandline command: Rscript MVP_gf_fitting_script.R arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5
