# MVP Pipeline

Code used to autonomously process output from the MVP Project simulations. Code is assumed to be run in the order presented here; in some cases downstream code depends on files created from upstream execution, see docstrings.

This pipeline assumes all files from a particular seed are in the same folder given as `slimdir` input arguments given to .py scripts.

## Cloning and setting up the MVP-offsets repository for production runs
Before running scripts, users will need to set up the Anaconda environments below. First, however, the MVP-offsets repository will need to be cloned to the local computer.

After cloning, export the path of the 01_src directory to PYTHONPATH within `$HOME/.bashrc`:

```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/MVP-offsets/01_src"
```

---
## Conda environments
Various [Anaconda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) are used across scripts. Users will need to install Anaconda (not miniconda) and be sure to allow the conda init within $HOME/.bashrc (you should be prompted during install).

**1. Python environment**
  - this python (v3.8.5) environment is used to start the pipeline and run all .py scripts in the repository
  - most python scripts depend on cloning [pythonimports from Brandon Lind](https://github.com/brandonlind/pythonimports). After cloning, create the environment by executing (after updating path):`conda env create -n mvp_env -f /path/to/pythonimports/py385.yml`. The path of the cloned repository will need to be exported to the PYTHONPATH within `$HOME/.bashrc` :

```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/pythonimports"
```

  - activate the mvp_env environment (`conda activate mvp_env`), then: `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-allel`

**2. Gradient Forests environment**
  - this R (v3.5) environment is used to run the GradientForests package v0.1-18
  - create this environment with the following command (updating path): `conda create -n r35 -f /path/to/MVP-offsets/01_src/gf_env.yml`
  - activate the gf_env environment (`conda activate r35`) then install GradientForests: `R CMD INSTALL /path/to/MVP-offsets/01_src/gradientForest_0.1-18.tar.gz`
  - open R, then: 
     -  `install.packages(data.table)`
     -  `install.packages(rgeos)`
     -  `install.packages(raster)`

**3. LFMM2/LEA + RDA environment**
  - this R (v4.0.3) environment is used to run lfmm2 from the LEA2 package, as well as redundancy analysis (RDA)
  - to retrieve the .yml file clone the [MVP-NonClinalAF repository](https://github.com/ModelValidationProgram/MVP-NonClinalAF/blob/main/src/env/MVP_env_R4.0.3.yml)
  - create this environment with the following command (updating path): `conda create -n lea_env -f /path/to/MVP-NonClinalAF/src/env/MVP_env_R4.0.3.yml`

## Pipelines
### Genetic Offset Pipeline

These scripts (MVP_00.py through MVP_13.py, and their dependencies) use simulations from [Lotterhos 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.03.502621) to train and validate the following genetic offset methods: Gradient Forests, the Risk Of Non-Adaptedness, LFMM, and redundancy analysis-based offset (RDA).

MVP_00_start_pipeline.py is used to kickstart this pipeline. Flags used will determine which offset method is run. See usage below.

### Climate outlier scenario pipeline

These scripts (MVP_14.py through MVP_21.py, and their dependencies) use trained models output from the Genetic Offset Pipeline to predict offset to climate scenarios that do not appear in the training data. Each offset method is run manually; the following will train and validate climate scenarios: MVP_14.py, MVP_16.py, MVP_18.py, MVP_20.py.
