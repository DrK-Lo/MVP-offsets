# MVP Pipeline

Code used to autonomously process output from the MVP Project simulations. Code is assumed to be run in the order presented here; in some cases downstream code depends on files created from upstream execution.

This pipeline assumes all files from a particular seed are in the same folder given as input arguments to .py scripts (i.e., `slimdir`). Scripts then create a directory structure for output as follows:


```
parent_directory (`outdir` arg to MVP_01_train_gradient_forests.py) can handle multiple seed outputs
│
└─── gradient_forests
│   │
│   └─── training
│       │
│       └─── training_files - files used as input to train gradient forests
│       │
│       └─── training_outfiles - RDS R files output from the training script
│       │
│       └─── training_shfiles - sbatch files for, and stdout.out files from, slurm

                between predicted offset and simulated fitness

### MVP_01_train_gradient_forests.py

This script creates necessary infiles to train Gradient Forests (GF), and submits slurm jobs to train GF using the script `MVP_gf_training_script.R` for a specific simulation `seed`; and queues up MVP_02.py and MVP_03.py to begin once training is complete. See docstring and code comments for more details.

1. Subset VCF for the samples randomly selected from the full set of sims (~1000 individuals)
2. Create genetic infiles for GF
    - Convert individual genotypes to counts of global minor allele
    - Create a pool-seq-like file that contains population-level frequencies of the global minor allele (to compare to individual input to gradient forests)
    - Using loci known to underlie adaptation in the sims, create a genetic infile that contains only these loci (to compare to output when using all loci in sims)
    - These steps create four files for GF training - 1) indSeq adaptive, 2) indSeq all, 3) poolSeq adaptive, 4) poolSeq all
3. Create environmental infiles for GF for individual and population-level (poolSeq-like) analyses
4. Submits training script for all four training scenarios to slurm. In addition, it creates a second slurm job that is dependent upon the successful completion of all four GF training runs - this dependent job will execute MVP_02.py and MVP_03.py.


### MVP_02_fit_gradient_forests.py

This script should be executed after all four training scenarios from MVP_01 are complete (this is submitted to slurm and will run if training completes successfully for all four training scenarios for a particular seed). It takes the four training scenarios and fits each to every environment in the simulated landscape (as of now, there are 100 populations) using `MVP_gf_fitting_script.R`. This is like predicted offset to the climate of a common garden, where we have common gardens in each subpopulation's environment. See docstring and code comments for more details.

1. Retrieve environmental data from all populations and create files with uniform climate (one for each transplant environment) - these newly created files will be the 'future' climate scenario, one for each subpopulation/common garden location.
2. Fit trained models of GF to these uniform climates

### MVP_03_validate_gradient_forests.py

Using the predicted offset from trained models of GF and the known fitness of individuals (or mean population fitness) within/across subpops to calculate Spearman's rho^2. Visualize performance using figures - see directory structure above. See also docstring and code comments for more details.

### MVP_04_env_importance_from_gradient_forests.py

(TODO - finish translating .ipynb to .py)

Using `MVP_extract_importance.R`, extract environmental importance values inferred from GF training. See docstring and code comments for more details.

### MVP_05_train_RONA.py

(TODO - add in adaptive validation)

Using population-level frequencies of the global minor allele (created in MVP_01.py), estimate the Risk Of Non-Adaptedness (Rellstab et al. 2016). Do so for loci with significant linear models from either the full loci set, or from those known to underlie adaptation in the sims (TODO). See docstring and code comments for more details.

1. For all loci, for each environment, calculate linear models (slope, intercept, pval) between population-level allele frequencies and population climate.
2. Identify loci with significant linear models
3. Use loci with significant linear models to calculate RONA for each pop for each env

### MVP_06_validate_RONA-TODO.py

Using the predicted RONA and population mean fitness within/across subpopulations, calculate Spearman's rho^2 for each env. As with MVP_03.py, visualize within common gardens (transplant fitness vs predicted transplant RONA) and for source populations (how well source pops transplant fitness matched predicted RONA of the remaining gardens). See docstring and code comments for more details.

TODO - do we want to use a Euclidean distance across envs instead of a RONA per env?

### MVP_07_calc_WC_pairwise_FST.py

Using individual-level allele counts for the global minor allele (created in MVP_01.py), calculate population pairwise FST with scikit-allel; population pairwise FST is a prerequisite to estimate General Dissimilarity models (MVP_08.py).
